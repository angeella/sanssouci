\usage{
SimesThresholdFamily(m, kMax = m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{The number of hypotheses tested}

\item{kMax}{For simultaneous control of (\eqn{k}-FWER for all \eqn{k \le
k[max]}).}
}
\value{
A threshold function (on the scale of test statistics) based on the
classical family of thresholds introduced by Simes (1986):
\eqn{\alpha*k/m}. This family yields joint FWER control at level (at most)
\eqn{\alpha} if the test statistics are positively dependent (PRDS) under
H0.
